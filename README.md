Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Dart. This program allows two players to take turns and play Tic Tac Toe in the terminal. The game validates user input and checks for a winner or a draw after each move.

How It Works

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, represented by the numbers 1 to 9. Players take turns placing their symbol ("X" or "O") in an empty spot on the grid. The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.

Features:

Clear and dynamic grid rendering.

Validates user input to ensure it is a number between 1 and 9.

Prevents overwriting occupied grid spots.

Detects winning combinations and announces the winner.

Declares a draw if all spots are filled without a winner.

How to Play

1. Starting the Game:

Run the Dart script in your terminal to start the game.

The initial grid will display numbers 1-9, representing the positions where players can place their moves.

2. Player Turns:

Players alternate turns.

"X" goes first, followed by "O".

On your turn, enter a number corresponding to an empty spot on the grid to place your symbol.

3. Winning the Game:

The first player to align three of their symbols ("X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

The game announces the winner and ends.

4. Draw:

If all grid spots are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game declares a draw.
